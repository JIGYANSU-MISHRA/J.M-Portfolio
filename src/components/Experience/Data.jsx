My responsibilities included writing clean, scalable code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js. I collaborated with designers and backend developers to implement user interfaces, optimize performance, and ensure cross-browser compatibility. During the internship, I gained hands-on experience with version control systems (Git), API integration, and debugging tools, while improving my problem-solving and teamwork skills in a real-world development environment.
